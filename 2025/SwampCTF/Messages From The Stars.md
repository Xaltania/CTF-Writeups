## Challenge

We recently detected this signal from deep space, we aren't quite sure what to make of it but we suspect it originated from intelligent life. Want to take a crack at decoding it?

`message_from_the_stars.wav`

## Solution
When it comes to audio, there are many ideas that come to mind, however, the challenge was simply two frequencies. I could immediately rule out Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency, dial-up, modems etc.

As a producer, it's pretty easy to extract frequencies and rhythms from an audio file, so I quickly plopped the file into FLStudio (rather than writing a script) and identified that the audio file was consistently playing sounds at 900Hz and 1100Hz. We could just double confirm this by plotting the frequency throughout the entire file.

It was beeping at around 13 per second, with this info we could write a quick script and transform the audio into a binary stream. I tried a couple things with the output, to no avail. Then I suddenly recalled an audio file from a video I saw in high school, the [Arecibo Message](https://archive.org/details/the-arecibo-message) which was essentially a message sent to the cosmos to broadcast our existence.

I thought it had to be connected, since it's literally "Messages From The Stars", so I tried encoding the bytes as colours and formed a bitmap, it did not work. By a stroke of luck, I put on my girlfriend's glasses to fiddle and at a distance, I noticed it: the ASCII art. I quickly transformed the 0's and 1's into `.` and `â–ˆ`s and the result was

Write another bash script to vary the width and:
